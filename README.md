Your pictures, exactly as you took it, only for your eyes to see.

Locations is a privacy-focused camera app.
Whenever you take a picture with Locations, the image is enriched with location and time metadata and is then safely encrypted on you own device.

Locations empowers you to remember your most precious moments while being sensitive about who gets to see them.
